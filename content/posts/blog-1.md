Not the happiest article to start a blog with but hey you got to start somewhere.
University is a place where you come to learn and connect with people. You are
taught multiple grueling courses within your time at uni and most of the time
you hate them more than loving. Uni is also the place where you are encouraged
to explore what you love.

I loved computing since i was a kid but never put the effort in understanding
to the point where I can create. Even thought what drew me into computing was
the promise of creating almost anything out of nothing but words. So when it came
to uni I never changed this effort in pursing by my own and led to suffering and
managing to pass sometimes barely and sometimes well in my courses. I luckly
managed to land a good internship still didn't perform the best I could and
didn't put into effort as much as I should have.

This lack of effort bit me first during my initial FYP submission, where i failed
to submit. And later meaning right now June 4th 2025, it bit me again. I had my
first official SE role interview and failed like I never have before. Simple
questions of .Net and even from the domain I am suppose to be good at according
to my CV of using Redux were not answered.

I had built an ego on my head, thinking that been good in ALevel computing is
going to carry be all the way. This was the worst mistake I've done in my IT
journey. I stopped asking questions and worse asking the same question to my-self.

This blog is a start of a change. I am giving my-self 5 months starting now to
become a really really good engineer. And to do so and keep leverage I will be
posting a blog every week with the stuff I'm doing.
