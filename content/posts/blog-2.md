## 11 days Not many plays

All right lets run this! 
12 days have gone by since starting 30 days 30 plays and we basically did nothing, amazing right. 
Day 11 was probably when some work started and made my favorite work buddy claude while I just 
sat there. 

Ended up with running a rat race in implementing a causcade system design to improve 
shipwreck detection. Failed miserabaly, suprising right. Will be going into some detail on what happened 
on 12th in the next blog. Plan is to start blogging my progress every night so i can keep track of my work
and myself.

Thinks learned - AI is an assistant not a replacement ( atleast yet ).
